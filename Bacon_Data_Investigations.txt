Completed Analysis:
Scatterplots-- (simple graphic, looking for patterns in the data)
-Average Headcount vs Fill Rate (broken up by market and which quarter the company joined the platform)

Correlation Mapping (searching for correlation between any and all of the following metrics)--
-General Metrics: Average Headcount, Average Hourly Wage, Average Shift-Post Lead Time, Average Days Between Shifts, 2023 Revenue, Fill Rate, Shifts Worked, Total Head Count Requested
(also broken up by market and which quarter the company joined the platform)

Logistical Regression--
Michael's scatterplot showing time since first shift and time since most recent shift, color indicating the "good" group (i.e., 
companies that have joined in the last year, but have had a shift very recently)



Current Analysis:
Correlation Mapping--
-30 Day Effect: Fill Rate, Head Count Worked, Shifts Worked, Average Days Between Shifts, and Shift Lead Time as compared to the same metrics 
after the first 30 days (so we can conclude if the first 30 days set a pattern or not)



Future Analysis:
Scatterplots--
-First 30 Day Effect, color coordinated by decile
