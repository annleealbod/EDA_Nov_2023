General Question: 
What factors have an effect on client experience? What causes in increase in net revenue, shifts worked, fillrate, total_headcount, etc?

Each company is a dot in the scatterplot, we will separate out companies into groups of markets (i.e. Utah, Texas, Nevada, and all others).

Some ideas of factors that could be affecting client experience:
-shift lead time
-hourly wage
-average head count
-average time inbetween shifts
-client industry 
-fill rate of first shift worked (and also fill rate of first 30 days on app)

***After some initial analysis, my boss and I think that companies that have been posting shifts on our platform for a long time but relatively inconsistently are skewing the data.
New approach: also separate by companies who posted their first shifts in Q3 or Q4 of last year, and companies that posted their shift before that.
Now we are looking at things in visualizations2.ipynb instead.


*****Not finding anything particularly interesting in visualizations2, we move onto visualizations3 to analyze thefatherlode.csv
Susan wanted to look at the following for each company and its respective affect on net revenue, total_headcount, etc etc:

First Shift: head_count, fill_rate, lead_time                                                                       (vs. total head_count after first_shift)
First 30 Days on Platform: total_shfits (count of shift_id), head_count, fill_rate, time_between_shifts             (vs. total_headcount after first 30 days)
